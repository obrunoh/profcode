    <h1>Die for you - The Weeknd</h1>
    <audio src="audio/die for you.mp3.mp3" controls></audio><br>

    I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through<br>
    I just can't say I don't love you<br>
    'Cause I love you, yeah<br>
    It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold<br>
    But tonight I'm gon' let you know<br>
    Let me tell the truth<br>
    Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br>
    <br>
    You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
    You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
    You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night<br>
    I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
    I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
    I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
    It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
    And I know that you're worth it<br>
    I can't walk away, oh!<br>
    <br>
    Even though we're going through it<br>
    And it makes you feel alone<br>
    Just know that I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    The distance and the time between us<br>
    It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
    I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    <br>
    I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through<br>
    But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you<br>
    Just don't blame me, too, yeah<br>
    'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>
    And you won't find no one that's better<br>
    'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>
    I think I'm right for you, babe<br>
    <br>
    You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
    You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
    It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
    And I know that you're worth it<br>
    I can't walk away, oh!<br>
    <br>
    Even though we're going through it<br>
    And it makes you feel alone<br>
    Just know that I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    The distance and the time between us<br>
    It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
    I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    <br>
    I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
    Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
    I'm just sayin', yeah<br>
    I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
    Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
    Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na<br>
    <br>
    Even though we're going through it<br>
    And it makes you feel alone<br>
    Just know that I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
    The distance and the time between us<br>
    It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
    I would die for you<br>
    Baby, I would die for you, yeah babe<br>

    <h1>Post Malone, Swae Lee - Sunflower</h1>

        [Swae Lee]<br>
    Needless to say, I keep her in check<br>
    She was all bad-bad, nevertheless<br>
    Calling it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck<br>
    Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck<br>
    Needless to say, I keep her in check<br>
    She was all bad-bad, nevertheless<br>
    Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck<br>
    Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck<br>
    Thinking in a bad way, losing your grip<br>
    Screaming at my face, baby, don't trip<br>
    Someone took a big L, I don't know how that felt<br>
    Looking at you sideways, party on tilt<br>
    Some things you just can't refuse<br>
    She wanna ride like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose<br>
    <br>
    Then you're left in the dust<br>
    Unless I stuck by ya<br>
    You're a sunflower<br>
    I think your love would be too much<br>
    Or you'll be left in the dust<br>
    Unless I stuck by ya<br>
    You're the sunflower<br>
    You're the sunflower<br>
    <br>
    [Post Malone]<br>
    Every time I'm leaving on ya<br>
    You don't make it easy, no<br>
    Wish I could be there for you<br>
    Give me a reason to go<br>
    Every time I'm walking out<br>
    I can hear you telling me to turn around<br>
    Fighting for my trust and you won't back down<br>
    Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh<br>
    I know you're scared of the unknown<br>
    You don't wanna be alone<br>
    I know I always come and go<br>
    But it's out of my control<br>
    <br>
    And you'll be left in the dust<br>
    Unless I stuck by ya<br>
    You're the sunflower<br>
    I think your love would be too much<br>
    Or you'll be left in the dust<br>
    Unless I stuck by ya<br>
    You're the sunflower<br>
    You're the sunflower<br>
